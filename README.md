User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
 I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
 SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:

WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar (YES)

WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours (YES)

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
    THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future (Sometimes)

WHEN I click into a time block
    THEN I can enter an event (YES)

WHEN I click the save button for that time block
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage (YES)

WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist (No)
